    "text": "This post is an introduction to the here package, a powerful tool that helps maintain best practices in reproducible workflows.\nBefore using the here package I faced two main issues.\nInitially, I thought using a consistent folder structure with RStudio‚Äôs projects 1 would fix the first issue. This did temporarily solve my 1st problem, however, to make matters worse, my work system was fixed and the root directory changed. This added further complexity to my workflow.\nAs a result, I found myself writing separate sets of code to work effectively in both locations.\nI encountered further difficulties when I tried to automate my workflow by sourcing files. Alas, this made me go grrr üò†.\nThe answer to the troubles are in the here package.\n1pacman::p_load(here)\n2here()\n\n\n1\n\nInstalls and loads the package\n\n2\n\nTells you where the root is\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"D:/MyRProjects/SoundReproSteps\"\nüìçBy knowing where the root is helps you write better file paths.\nFor example, let‚Äôs say this is your folder structure.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectName.Rproj\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅData\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_to_use.csv\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅDocs\n‚Äì ‚Äî‚Äî‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example1.R\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example2.Rmd"
