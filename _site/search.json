In this blog, we explore how R can help us achieve reproducibility in our research and share tips and best practices for making our work transparent and reproducible."

    "text": "This post is an introduction to the here package, a powerful tool that helps maintain best practices in reproducible workflows.\nBefore using the here package I faced two main issues.\nInitially, I thought using a consistent folder structure with RStudio’s projects 1 would fix the first issue. However, this solution created additional confusion because my work computer’s operating system was different from my home computer’s. To make matters worse, my work system was fixed and the root directory changed, which added further complexity to my workflow.\nAs a result, I found myself writing separate sets of code to work effectively in both locations.\nI encountered further difficulties when I tried to automate my workflow by sourcing files. Alas, this made me go grrr 😠.\nThe answer to the troubles are in the here package.\n1pacman::p_load(here)\n2here()\n\n\n1\n\nInstalls and loads the package\n\n2\n\nTells you where the root is\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"D:/MyRProjects/SoundReproSteps\"\n📍By knowing where the root is helps you write better file paths.\nFor example, let’s say this is your folder structure.\n├── ProjectName.Rproj\n├── 📁Data\n——– ├── data_to_use.csv\n├── 📁Docs\n– ——├── example1.R\n——– ├── example2.Rmd"
