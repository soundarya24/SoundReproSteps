Although I showed up consistently, the struggle to manage my workflow was exhausting. Then, it hit me—I was missing the key ingredient that would transform my process: Reproducibility.\nThis is why I advocate for reproducibility as a compelling reason to learn R.\n\nStarting with reproducibility, even as a beginner, makes learning R so much more meaningful and rewarding!"

This did temporarily solve my 1st problem, however, to make matters worse, my work system was fixed and the root directory changed. This added further complexity to my workflow.\nAs a result, I found myself writing separate sets of code to work effectively in both locations.\nI encountered further difficulties when I tried to automate my workflow by sourcing files. Alas, this made me go grrr 😠.\nThe answer to the troubles are in the here package.\n1pacman::p_load(here)\n2here()\n\n\n1\n\nInstalls and loads the package\n\n2\n\nTells you where the root is\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"D:/MyRProjects/SoundReproSteps\"\n📍By knowing where the root is helps you write better file paths.\nFor example, let’s say this is your folder structure.\n├── ProjectName.Rproj\n├── 📁Data\n——– ├── data_to_use.csv\n├── 📁Docs\n– ——├── example1.R\n——– ├── example2.Rmd"

    "text": "TLDR - A good movie and a good academic paper have striking similarities in their structure and impact.\nAcademic writing now requires good storytelling to engage readers effectively(“Storytelling in Research” 2018). Introducing characters and establishing a story arc with conflicts and resolutions creates a memorable experience that enhances the understanding and appreciation of research.\nIf you are new to the storytelling style in research writing, two key elements must not be missed: a hooking introduction and a central theme. A hooking introduction engages readers from the start, while a central theme provides the narrative structure that guides the reader through the research. These two elements are essential starting points for incorporating storytelling into your research writing."

    "text": "Hooking at the very beginning\nA good movie grabs your attention within the first ten minutes by portraying polarizing elements and leaving you wondering how these opposing characters will be brought together, creating suspense. Similarly, a well-written academic paper requires a hooking introduction. This can be achieved by using simple language and tailoring it to the central message that the paper conveys. A lengthy and boring introduction indicates that the writer is not clear about what they want to communicate. An excellent introduction keeps the reader engaged in the paper, even if the subject matter is outside their area of expertise. Hooking the reader and maintaining their engagement throughout the paper is crucial."

    "text": "Rippling the central message throughout the movie/paper\nIn a good movie, the central message gains strength and power as the story unfolds. Similarly, a well-written academic paper should gradually ripple the central message throughout the text, gaining momentum from supporting results, and leaving a lasting impact on the reader. A good movie that conveys its central message effectively leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, with all other aspects fading away in comparison. It is like a wave slowly gaining momentum until it hits you and leaves you drenched, and all you can recall is the message. Another effective way to leave a lasting impression is to make the central message the title of the paper.\n\nEach one of these is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is only when they become the big aggregate that we hear. — Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda by Swami Vivekananda\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Photoholgic on Unsplash"

    "text": "Accepting the limitations\nA good story may have its limitations, but the central message is often so strong that the audience is willing to overlook any flaws. Similarly, a well-written academic paper may have its limitations, but by explicitly acknowledging them and establishing a compelling central theme, the reader is more likely to accept any weaknesses and embrace the central message despite the limitations.\nA great paper and an excellent movie have more in common than you might think, and they both have the power to leave a lasting impression on their audience. It’s fascinating to see how these two seemingly different forms of storytelling can share many similarities. Can you think of any other parallels between the two? The possibilities are endless, and exploring them further could lead to new insights and perspectives on the art of storytelling."

    "text": "This post offers a disciplined approach to maintaining research logs and a proactive mindset for efficient and standardized data analysis sessions.\nWhen I was asked for a detailed analysis conducted last month, I faced two challenges. The steps were really detailed, making a lot of decisions necessary, and remembering the exact process a month later was tough. So, I turned to my log files.\nI keep detailed logs of every step in my analysis. While my main results file has the big decisions, the log files are like prompts, capturing every little thing with timestamps. Even though I could remember the main process, the detailed parts were much clearer in my log files than in my memory.\nMaintaining these logs with the logr package (Bosak 2022) turned out to be a smart move. Writing things down as I go makes it much easier than trying to recall everything later. This idea aligns with Long’s law of documentation:\nI learned this from J. Scott Long’s Stata book(Long 2008), a great resource, especially for those learning to code. Following this principle, I only wrap up an analysis session when I’m confident that the key details are safely stored in my log files.\nThis is a typical analysis session simplified."

    "title": "Why Making the Same Rasam Matters: A Story from the Kitchen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Reproducibility simplified for the general audience\nI recently gave a talk on reproducibility in science, which you can watch here. While my family and friends enjoyed the presentation, they expressed a desire for a simpler explanation. With this feedback in mind, I’ve attempted to distill the essence of reproducibility into a story that’s easier to grasp.\n\nI’ve always loved cooking, especially how different ingredients mix to create a unique dish. This could be anything from baking a cake to making a traditional South Indian sambar. My grandmother, an amazing cook in our family, once said something interesting about rasam, a popular soup: if you give ten people the same ingredients, they will make ten different types of rasam.\nWhat she meant was simple but important – it’s hard to make the exact same dish every time, and that teaches us something about science too.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Pixabay: https://www.pexels.com/photo/two-teal-ceramic-bowls-262947/\n\n\nLet’s talk about making rasam the same way every time and why it’s important. In cooking, different versions of rasam can be fun. But in science, we want results to be the same if we do the same experiment. This helps us trust the results. Imagine if someone says they made rasam, but it tastes like sambar – that’s a mix-up we want to avoid. If everyone understands the recipe the same way, then they can all make the same rasam. This is similar in science, where we want experiments to give us the same results every time.\n\n“The best way to know if something is true is to check it more than once.”\n\nReproducibility is a big word that means “can we get the same result (rasam) again?” This is very important in science. If one person’s experiment gives a certain result, other people should be able to do the same experiment and get the same result. This is like ensuring that if you follow the recipe, you should end up with the rasam you wanted to make.\n\nJust like we double-check our answers in an exam, scientists double-check their experiments.\n\nBut here’s the issue: not all scientific experiments give the same results when repeated. This is like when someone can’t make rasam the same way twice. This is a problem in science because if results can’t be repeated, it can lead to wasted money and even dangerous mistakes in serious fields like medicine.\nI talked about this issue because we need better ways to do science, just like we have clear recipes in cooking. I suggested these three steps we should follow in science, just like in the kitchen:\n\nClear Counters: Just like you need a clean kitchen to cook well, scientists need to organize their data and materials clearly.\nRecipe Book: Writing down every step of an experiment is important. This is like writing down each step in a recipe so someone else can make the same rasam.\nFresh vs. Used Ingredients: In cooking, we keep fresh and used ingredients separate. Scientists should do the same with their data to avoid mix-ups.\n\nI also talked about sharing our recipes, just like sharing our experiments. If someone wants to make rasam, they can follow a recipe. I touched upon a software called R, which will help scientists do reproducible research.\nSo, understanding and sharing how we do things is key, whether we’re making a rasam or doing a science experiment. This helps everyone know they’re on the right track.\n\nLet’s keep science as straightforward and reliable as a good recipe – that way, everyone can trust the results, just like they trust a good meal."

They start their data analysis or visualization and find it very hard to proceed. They give up and move to other tools. There is a secret to approach R in a better way. This will not make you a pro overnight, but it will make you realize why you should embrace R as a beginner, despite its steep learning curve.\nListen, folks: R isn’t rocket science.\nI’m neither a programmer nor a coder, but I conduct all my statistical analysis in R. The possibilities and capacities of R never cease to amaze me.\nIn 2019, I approached R for its data visualization capabilities. I was fascinated by the beautiful and insightful graphs I could create. But as I delved deeper, I discovered R’s true potential: reproducibility.\nTo keep things simple, I would define reproducibility in the context of this blog as the ability to recreate an analysis you did by anyone, anywhere, at any time. This is the essence of R. I wrote a blog post on how conducting reproducible research even as a beginner can be a game-changer.\nViewing R as difficult software that requires coding, and feeling threatened by its steep learning curve, is why you make no progress. Approaching R for its reproducibility capabilities is the key to unlocking its potential as a beginner. Once this parallel world opens, you never want to go back.\nR stands out among other software due to its strong emphasis on reproducibility. Unlike many other tools, R allows you to document every step of your analysis process within scripts, ensuring that your work can be exactly replicated by anyone, anywhere, at any time. This transparency and accuracy are vital for robust data analysis and scientific research.\nI offer 3 best practices and 3 mistakes to avoid to embrace reproducibility as an R beginner:"

There is a natural traction to do that.\nWhen you start in R, with just the “ABCs,” you will gain strength and confidence to move forward. You will also notice that there are flaws in your workflows, stumbling blocks, and accumulating files that deteriorate your further learning. The more you learn, the more you create, and the more .r files and outputs you generate. You can do R now, but it is not enjoyable—the initial honeymoon phase has ended.\nWhile as beginners, we just wanted to get the code out to produce the plot we wanted, a reproducible researcher, however, thinks differently. From the beginning, they plan, conduct, and wrap up their analysis with reproducibility in mind. Why? Because it helps them grow, allows for improvement, and creates workflows they can scale and build upon.\nHere, I will list the common problems encountered in R as a beginner without reproducibility and later introduce a minimal viable reproducible workflow to start.

You’ll always know which script to edit when something needs fixing.\n\n\nAvoid Saving Output Files\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, the goal is to avoid saving outputs like graphs and tables. Instead, focus on saving the code that generates them. Think of the code as the recipe—the “cooking” only takes a few minutes, and you can always reproduce your results quickly when needed.\nBy following these reproducibility principles, you can avoid common pitfalls, improve your workflow, and build projects that are easier to manage and scale.\n\n\n\nCredit: Photo by Breakingpic"

This frustration underscores the very essence of reproducibility, illustrating why it is not merely a technicality in research, but a crucial aspect of scientific integrity.\n\n\nA Real-Life Experience: The Splint That Couldn’t Be Used\nMy mom developed hallux valgus, or a deviated great toe, and we bought a splint for her. It came with an information booklet, but we couldn’t decipher how to use the product properly. All we saw was an assembled image of how it should be worn, but the information booklet only added to the confusion. It was filled with details that were difficult to follow in practice. The hinge on the splint kept moving when we tried it on her foot, and we weren’t sure whether the hinge should be on the side or above the toe. Finally, we gave up on the booklet and figured it out ourselves. Still, we had issues managing the straps, and after we thought we had everything set up, my mom complained of pain from the strap scraping her skin.\n\n\nThe Parallel to Research: When Methods Fail Us\nThis experience mirrors a common issue in research: the methods sections we write often fail to consider whether others can follow and replicate our procedures. Just as the splint’s instructions were unclear, leaving us frustrated, poorly written methods in research create barriers for others attempting to reproduce results. If we don’t keep the needs of the reader in mind—someone who may be unfamiliar with the work—it becomes nearly impossible for them to replicate the study. Ultimately, methods that are not accessible and explicit undermine the very purpose of sharing research.\n\n\nThe Need for Explicit Methods in Research\n\nThe primary goal of writing research papers is to allow others to learn from, build on, and replicate our work.\n\nTo achieve this, the methods section must be explicit—detailed enough that even someone new to the subject can understand and independently follow the procedure. Clarity in writing is crucial, not just in outlining the methods but also in documenting the analysis. Both aspects must be reproducible, ensuring that others—and even our future selves—can retrace the steps with precision. Without this level of transparency, the value of our research is diminished, as its core purpose—reproducibility—remains unmet.\n\n\nLogbooks: A Simple Solution to a Complex Problem\nA detailed logbook offers a simple yet powerful solution to the challenges of reproducibility. By documenting errors, solutions, and key decisions throughout the analysis, researchers create a comprehensive guide that makes it easier to retrace steps and replicate findings. &gt; The process requires some mindful stops: periodically pausing to summarize the key points in the logbook, ensuring nothing crucial is overlooked.\nThis logbook can take many forms, from a basic text file (.txt) to more specialized formats like .rmd or Quarto files in R. Personally, I prefer a minimalist, handwritten logbook to clearly distinguish it from other analysis documents.\n\n\n\nA peek into my logbook\n\n\nBefore I write my methods section, I simply consult my logbook to recall the steps taken, the decisions made, and the rationale behind them. This practice not only enhances reproducibility but also serves as a valuable resource for future projects by us and others. By investing time in maintaining a logbook, we invest in the integrity and longevity of our research.\n\nI wrote a post on using the logr package for logging my analysis on the go. Read it here\n\n\n\nWriting for Others\nConsider the First-Time Reader Just as the splint manufacturer likely intended for their product to be user-friendly, they failed to ensure that the instructions were clear for a first-time user. The booklet seemed written by someone already familiar with the product, overlooking the needs of new customers. A simple quality check—giving the instructions to someone unfamiliar with the splint—could have exposed its flaws. In the same way, when writing research logs and methods, we must always consider the perspective of those encountering the information for the first time. This ensures that our work is accessible and reproducible, which is critical to advancing science. Ultimately, reproducibility should always be the goal.\n\nResearch Isn’t Done Until It’s Reproducible!\n\n\n\n\nLogbook Photo by ALTEREDSNAPS"

    "text": "You might have read earlier in my blog about how reproducibility relates to rasam. Today, I came up with another example after reading Reproducible Research in Practice (Kitzes, Turek, and Deniz 2018), an excellent book.\nWhen you decide to cook something, what do you do?\n\nYou buy groceries and bring them home.\nYou prepare them.\nYou cook them.\n\nSimilarly, reproducible pipelines have three major steps:\n\nImporting your data.\nCleaning and preparing the data for analysis.\nConducting the data analysis.\n\n\n\n\nReproducible data analysis is akin to cooking (Viz by Soundarya)\n\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there!\nWhen you cook, there’s often a recipe—a written guide. This recipe is akin to writing scripts for how your analysis was conducted. With a recipe, you can recreate your dish. Similarly, with scripts, you can recreate your analysis.\nNow, imagine doing this without a recipe. It’d be chaotic! But when you hand over the recipe card, others can reproduce your dish. Likewise, when you share your scripts, others can reproduce your analysis. Of course, you’d need to provide the same groceries too—just like reproducible analysis requires you to share the data alongside your scripts.\n\n\n\nScripts are recipe cards (Viz by Soundarya)\n\n\nLastly, let’s talk about tidying up. When cooking, you clear the clutter—cleaning the workspace so you’re ready for the next task. In data analysis, this is like closing your session with a clean workspace, leaving only the scripts and data ready for use. This ensures the next analysis uses the most recent data and scripts, much like making sure your meal uses fresh ingredients and the latest recipe.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKitzes, Justin, Daniel Turek, and Fatma Deniz, eds. 2018.

    "title": "Are You Ready When It Fails? Lessons from Network Outages in Reproducible Data Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At 10.30 AM on a crucial workday, my mobile network suddenly went dark—zero connectivity. My heart raced since I needed that connection for… hmmm.. EVERYTHING. Eventually, we discovered that the outage affected the entire city, revealing a surprising vulnerability in our telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n\n\nPhoto by MART PRODUCTION\n\n\nI had always assumed companies distribute mobile towers spatially, meaning a problem in one area would only affect a small region. However, this incident exposed a critical insight: one hub controlled all city networks. This realization was alarming because if something goes wrong at the hub, it cascades through the entire system, affecting millions of users simultaneously.\nThis experience taught me a valuable lesson about system dependencies and failure points—a lesson that directly applies to how we should approach data analysis. In fact, the parallels between telecommunications infrastructure and data workflows became increasingly clear as I examined my own analytical processes.\nIn my data analysis workflow, I use three interdependent scripts that function like a chain of command. Script 1 performs data cleaning, taking raw data and outputting a cleaned version. Building on this foundation, Script 2 generates new variables, taking Script 1’s output as its input and producing a more refined dataset. Finally, Script 3 creates visualizations, using the clean data from Script 2 to generate meaningful insights.\nTo coordinate these components, I have a master script that automates the execution of all these scripts sequentially—similar to a “hub” that coordinates all the mobile towers. While this workflow mirrors the mobile network’s centralized control system, I’ve implemented a crucial difference: unlike the mobile network’s workflow, I don’t solely rely on the master script. Even if something goes wrong, I can still manually run each script (1, 2, and 3) individually.\nThe real issue arises if one of these scripts or their outputs is missing, as this would break the sequence. To mitigate this risk, I’ve always ensured I store the outputs of Script 1, so Script 2 can proceed even if Script 1 is not re-run. Although this approach diverges from reproducibility principles, where data scientists typically discourage saving intermediate outputs and expect workflows to run seamlessly from start to finish, being prepared for unexpected failures has proven invaluable.\nTo protect my workflows, I implement three comprehensive strategies:\n\nUse a Master Script but Avoid Total Dependence\nWhile I use a master script for efficiency, I never trust it blindly. Each script is self-contained, clearly indicating its start and end points. When an error occurs, the scripts halt with a message, allowing me to pinpoint where the problem happened. For example, if I see the “data cleaning is completed” prompt, I know the issue lies in the next step, so I can directly revisit Script 3.\nSave Intermediate Outputs for Resilience\nAlthough it deviates from strict reproducibility principles, I save intermediate outputs as safety nets. To maintain updated datasets, I still run the master script to regenerate intermediates when raw data changes. This ensures consistency while providing a fallback option if the master script fails.\nBackup Raw Data in Multiple Locations\nI maintain backups of raw data in three different locations, ensuring I’m not left stranded in case of data loss or corruption.\n\n\nJust as a city’s mobile network relies on a central hub, many data analysis workflows depend on critical sequential steps. This vulnerability brings me to Murphy’s Law: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. By embracing this mindset, we can better protect our analyses through careful preparation. The key questions become: Are we prepared if something fails? Do we have backups? Have we stored critical outputs in multiple locations? Addressing these concerns proactively often helps avoid disaster.\nThinking through these potential pitfalls before starting an analysis ensures preparedness. Once a solid plan is in place, it can serve as a template for future projects. The ultimate question remains: Are you prepared for when things go wrong?"
